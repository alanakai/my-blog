Welcome to my first post!

I had such a momentous week, so this post may be a little longer than normal (though I've never done another post so I don't know what the normal length will be). This week I turned 18, worked my first shift at my first job and attended the first day of senior year.

# 18th Birthday:

My 18th birthday party was a great one. Because of quarentine I couldn't have a large gathering, so I didn't feel pressured to have something big. Making it more casual made it better for me because I generally build up in my mind what my birthday party is going to be like, but with a more last minute plan I had less time to build expectations (though I still definitely hard-core planned the party for the days leading up to it). My friends insisted on doing something special for my 18th birthday so we chose to do 18 activities, some big and some small. In order of when we did the activity here is a list and brief descriptions:

1. Thrift Flip - Each person bought an item at the thrift store and turned it into something else within the week. I was super proud of my outfit. I turned a really baggy dress that I found for $5 at Crossroads into a two piece set. I smocked the top and added straps and for the bottoms I made elastic waistband shorts.

2. Compare Schedules - Schedules came out on this day, the day before school started, so we compared ours and I found out I have quite a few classes with Annabelle.
3. Paint the Town - We ordered Paint the Town to go, which I picked up earlier that week. I painted a mug.
4. Karaoke - We played music and sang along during Paint the Town.
5. Birthday Parade - We walked one block down to the school down the street.
6. Activity at Park - We played a game that I had downloaded on my phone.
7. Photo Shoot - We stopped to take pictures randomly multiple times; we took some at the park and some at my house.
8. Birthday Feast - We ordered U-don for lunch (our usual u-district meal of choice before quarentine).
9. Give Gifts - I told them not to give gifts because they already had to pay for Paint the Town and the thrift store clothing. However, Brooke got me one of the light boxes that you can put quotes in, scrunchies, a disposable camera and a face mask. Stella got me some pop-rocks and one of those boards that you write on with water and then it disapears. 
10. Lottery Tickets - My dad gave me $50 to spend on lottery tickets (randomly given to him by a buddhist monk weeks ago and saved for lottery tickets). With that money I bought 10 $5 lottery tickets and 1 $1 ticket as a practice. We ended up winning $67, so I made the money back plus some!
11. Nailed It - We had a cupcake decorating competition based on the TV show Nailed It. The first challenge was recreating a cat cupcake (pictured below, mine is the middle cupcake and Annabelle won, second from left). The second challenge was to create a Alana or 18 themed cupcake. Madyson made one that was themed around lottery tickets and said 18. Annabelle made an "abstract version" of the captain america shield, and I had the same idea with making the shield but I added 18 in Pocky Sticks on top of the shield. Brooke made a sky that included a sun and stars and said the sun represented me and the stars represented my hopes and dreams. Stella, the winner, drew a picture of me on her cupcake (very impressive). By the way my mom judged all of the rounds.

12. Make Tiktok Video - We made one of the Tiktok videos that shows expectation versus reality with the cat cupcakes.
13. Sing Happy Birthday - Pretty self explanatory.
14. Blow Out Candles - Again self explanatory.
15. Eat Cupcake - There was so much sugar on them from the decorating. 
16. Birthday game - We didn't have a specific one but we felt like we could count something from before (it had been 6+ hours at this point)
17. Sidewalk mural - We did a sidewalk mural in front of the Jeep. It had balloons, cake, flowers and the number 18.
18. Dance party - We had a dance party while making our sidewalk mural

Other than my birthday party, Sofia stopped by and gave me cat-unicorn socks. My parents got me the movie scratch off poster I asked for, light tiles for my walls, and the acrylic paint I asked for. I also recieved a package from Mops and Sandy with a coloring book and some money. Pops and Jackie sent me an Amazon Card, and I had many birthday well wishers and calls.

For dinner dad made me corned beef and cabbage and we watched Sky High. He bought three cakes (though there are only three of us) and we made a small dent in those. After they went to bed I watched High School Musical the Concert and a few episodes of Hannah Montana while I finished painting my mug. What can I say, I was feeling nastalgic. 

Overall it was a pretty great 18th birthday!

# First Day of School:
We had our first day of school on a Friday before the three day weekend, I think they moved it here so they could fix any tech issues over the long weekend, which they ended up needing to do, as the school computers did not work. We had a 45 minute orientation, where I had a hard time hearing because it kept going in and out and then we had an hour of advisory where nothing super important happened.

# Jamba Juice:
I also started my first job this week! My first shift was on Friday and I worked from 12-5. I was mostly in the back room working on the work training videos on the computer. I worked on those for about 2 hours and then Eva and Joseph needed the computer so I went out the front and helped by washing the blenders and other dishes. Marley also showed me how to make my first smoothie, I made a Mega Mango because it was the first one I saw. I then went back onto the computer and continued working on my team member training, which I finished today at home. The other people I met at my shift not mentioned above are Olivia (Roosevelt, does track), Helen (Junior at UW), Andy (taught me faster way to wash blenders), and Brooke was also there for the last hour of my shift.

*Chosen by Brooke. It used to be printed on the Jamba juice shirts and was there to motivate me on my first day on the job as well as my first day of school.
